Example:
348597 => [7,9,5,8,4,3]

10. 8 kyu ~
    Return a new array consisting of elements which are multiple of their own index in input array (length > 1).

Some cases:

[22, -6, 32, 82, 9, 25] => [-6, 32, 25]

[68, -1, 1, -7, 10, 10] => [-1, 10]

[-56,-85,72,-26,-14,76,-27,72,35,-21,-67,87,0,21,59,27,-92,68] => [-85, 72, 0, 68]

12. 8 kyu ~
    Complete the function which takes two arguments and returns all numbers which are divisible by the given divisor. First argument is an array of numbers and the second is the divisor.

Example
divisibleBy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]

13. Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.
